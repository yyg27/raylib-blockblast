# BlockBlast
BlockBlast is a strategic puzzle game in which we randomly give 3 of the 25
tetromino pieces defined on an 8x8 screen and try to fill them in a row or column.

The game aims to place pieces on a certain grid and fill them linearly in a row or
column, thus earning points. It gives certain points for each correctly placed piece
and filled line, so players can compete to make the highest score.
